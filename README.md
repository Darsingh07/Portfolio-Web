# Portfolio-Web
"I've created a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and experiences in Frontend Development. It features my work from my internship at LG Electronics India, along with other projects that highlight my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and web scraping. The site is designed to provide an overview of my technical skills.
